For the next time I change something or just forget how it works:

Create a new migration:
    Open terminal from Db project!
    dotnet ef migrations add MigrationName --startup-project "../App"
    
Update database - Apply migrations
    Open terminal from Db project!
    dotnet ef database update --startup-project "../App"
    
Generate migration script from some base migration to latest migration
    Open terminal from Db project!
    dotnet ef migrations script <MIGRATION_ID> --startup-project "../App" > migrate.sql
    MIGRATION_ID is the full migration name including date stamp such as: 20181112043643_Initial
    Find migrate.sql and review changes
    Run script on database
